These symptoms can be magnified after a bout of exacerbation, which could in turn lead to a downward spiral of functional decline after hospital discharge. The vicious cycle of exacerbation and functional deterioration can accelerate disease progression, worsen long-term prognosis and increase hospital readmissions.</p>
<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a highly effective treatment that has been reported to mitigate the aforementioned, improve their quality of life, exercise tolerance and confidence in self-management strategies such as early self-recognition, compliance with exercise and secretion management. However, rehabilitating these patients can be challenging because of their evident respiratory symptoms. It is thus critical to have the knowledge on achieving a fine balance between having a treatment plan that is of sufficient intensity to bring about benefits but at the same time minimising symptoms and adverse effects. Patient education is also imperative to ensure patients are adequately empowered to manage their respiratory symptoms as they thrive in the community. Alongside, to help them live well, palliative interventions where required should be incorporated to alleviate more persistent respiratory symptoms, help support them through the disease process and improve their quality of life. These interventions can be delivered and reinforced in the community. This workshop aims to equip physiotherapists with the knowledge needed to manage patients with chronic lung diseases in the community.</p>
